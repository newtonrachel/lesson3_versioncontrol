            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System, or VCS, is used to track and control changes to a project’s files. VCS automatically notes who changed a file, when they changed it, what they changed, and merge changes to the same file. There are several benefits to VCS. One is that the files cannot be overwritten. As well as this, people can work on the same files at the same time without any conflict. This is very helpful for projects performed by a team. VCS also allows you to revert back to an older version of the file if you need to. VCS is useful for projects that don’t require teams as well, because it will back up your files so you don’t lose work.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Types of Version Control Systems include Local VCSs, Distributed VCSs, and Centralized VCSs. A Local VCS which has a simple database that keeps all the changes to files under revision control. These were developed because many people’s version-control method was to copy files into another directory, which is very error prone. Centralized VCSs were developed because people often need to collaborate with developers on other systems. CVCSs have a single server that contains all versioned files and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. A CVCS has several advantages over a Local VCS. Distributed Version Control Systems fully mirror the repository. This is useful if any server dies because then any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source VCS that is meant to handle anything from small to large projects easily and efficiently. There are several reasons why developers should use Git. One of the main benefits of Git is that it’s extremely fast. Git is also very efficient with large projects. The major difference between Git and other VCS is that Git thinks of data more like snapshots of a miniature file system, as opposed to a set of files. Also, Git mostly only needs local files and resources, as opposed to information from a another computer on your network. This is what makes Git so much faster. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are several different Git commands that are important to know in order to record changes to your Git repository. One important command is git status, which is used to determine which files are in which state. For example, it will tell you if you have any “untracked files” that were not present in your previous snapshot. These snapshots are made by the command git commit. If you want to remove a file you use the git rm command. Some other basic commands include git init, git add, and git log. The three basic commands are add, commit, and push. It is important to have a working knowledge of these commands before you attempt to work on your Git repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording changes to the Respository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Your git repository should have a working copy of the files for the project you are working on. It is important to commit snapshots of the changes you make into your repository every time the project reaches a state you want to record. Each file in the working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot. Tracked files can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are files that were not present in your last snapshot. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified. Your files become modified as you make changes to them. You stage these modified files and then commit all your stage changes, and the cycle repeats.</p>
